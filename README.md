## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I strengthened my knowledge of responsive design and managing different states based on the user's actions.  A responsive design needed to be adapted to a variety of screens over time. Hovering and focusing will also enhance the user experience.  Reinforce my understanding of TailwindCSS and class and style customization.


### Continued development

There are some things I would like to keep using in my future projects, such as TailwindCSS customization and managing states as objects in React. I really like doing a project like this that requires patience and gives the highest quality user experience possible. I'll keep focusing on this in the future.
